# Sign Language Recognition Using AI/ML
This project aims to build a system that recognizes sign language gestures using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide an accessible solution for translating sign language into text or speech in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time Sign Language Detection**: Detects gestures and translates them on the fly.
- **AI/ML Model Integration**: Utilizes machine learning models to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
- **Multi-User Support**: Recognizes signs across various users.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface for interaction and display of translations.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: 
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch for ML models
  - OpenCV for image processing
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
- **Testing**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
