# Sign Language Recognition Project

## General Introduction

This project aims to develop a real-time sign language recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Our application captures video input from a webcam, detects hand gestures, and translates them into text, facilitating communication for individuals using sign language.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from webcam
- Hand detection using pre-trained models
- Recognition of basic sign language gestures
- On-screen display of recognized gestures as text
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Technologies

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV for video processing
- TensorFlow for machine learning models
- NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
- Git for version control

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Karthik-debugger/Team-Debuggers-git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd sign-language-recognition

# Run the main application
Python main.py

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

After launching the application:

1. Position your hand in front of the camera
2. Perform sign language gestures
3. View the recognized signs as text on the screen

Note: Currently, the system can recognize a limited set of gestures. We are working on expanding this capability.

## Future Steps

Our immediate next steps include:

1. Implementing recognition for additional sign language gestures
2. Improving the accuracy of the gesture recognition algorithm
3. Enhancing the user interface for better user experience
4. Implementing error handling and logging for all critical components

## Contributing

While the project is still in development, we are not yet ready for external contributions. We appreciate your interest and will update this section with contribution guidelines as the project stabilizes.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the current implementation, please file an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the development team at signlanguage.supp@gmail.com.
