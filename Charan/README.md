# Sign Language Recognition using AI/ML

## General Introduction
The **Sign Language Recognition using AI/ML** project aims to develop a system that can recognize and interpret sign language gestures using artificial intelligence and machine learning. This tool is designed to bridge communication between the hearing-impaired and those unfamiliar with sign language, making communication more accessible.

## Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition:** Recognizes gestures as they are made in real-time.
- **Multi-language Support:** Supports multiple sign language dialects.
- **Child-Friendly Mode:** Adapts to child-specific gestures and imprecise signs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for both users and developers.
- **Data Training and Model Optimization:** Allows for ongoing training and refinement of recognition models.

## Technologies
- **Python** for core scripting and model implementation.
- **OpenCV** for computer vision to process sign language gestures.
- **TensorFlow** for building and training machine learning models.
- **Numpy and Pandas** for libraries.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for developing code.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karthik-debugger/Team-Debuggers.git
   cd Team-Debuggers  
2. **Install the required packages**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
## Usage

#### Child-Friendly Recognition
This system is designed to support young users, such as a 7-year-old deaf child, with child-specific gestures and learning needs. Here’s how it caters to these users:

1. **Tolerance for Imperfect Signs:** 
- Machine learning algorithms have been trained with diverse signing data, including child-like variations, to enhance recognition accuracy in these cases.

3. **Customizable Recognition Sensitivity:**
   - Parents and teachers can adjust the recognition sensitivity to match the child’s skill level, ensuring a supportive and adaptive experience as they learn and improve.
   - This feature is especially useful for adjusting to the child’s needs over time or adapting the system to different environments, such as home or school.

4. **Patience Setting for Extended Signing Time:**
   - The system includes a "Patience Setting" that allows extra time for young users to complete each sign before translation, reducing the pressure of speed in communication.

5. **Child-Specific Expressions:**
   - The system recognizes common child-specific signs or gestures and can respond appropriately, enhancing communication efficiency and personalization.

6. **Environmental Adaptability:**
   - The recognition system remains effective in various environments, maintaining accuracy in settings such as home, school, or public spaces, thanks to the adaptable algorithms and child-friendly design.
