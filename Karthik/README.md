# Sign Language Recognition using AI/ML

## General Introduction
This project aims to create a real-time sign language recognition system to facilitate communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Using AI/ML, the system translates sign language gestures into text or speech, enhancing inclusivity in various settings.

## Features
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: Quickly detects and translates sign language gestures.
- **Better Accuracy**: Trained on diverse datasets for robust performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use in educational and general environments.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas
- **Version control**: Git
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karthik-debugger/Team-Debuggers.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:  
cd Team-Debuggers
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

The **Sign Language Recognition System** is designed to support educators in mixed-ability classrooms by facilitating communication between deaf and hearing students. Here’s how educators can use the system effectively:

#### Real-Time Translation for Classroom Interaction
1. **Enable Recognition Mode**:
   - Start the system by selecting **Recognition Mode** to detect and translate signs from deaf students.
   - The system will automatically begin recognizing signs and display translations on a shared screen or individual devices for all students to see.

2. **Subject-Specific Vocabulary**:
   - The system has been trained to recognize educational terminology, making it ideal for teaching specific subjects.
   - When a student signs subject-specific vocabulary, the system accurately translates and displays the terms on-screen.

3. **Question Mode for Student Inquiries**:
   - Instructors or students can activate **Question Mode** to allow deaf students to ask questions.
   - The student’s signed query is captured, translated, and displayed, enabling the educator and other students to understand and respond to the question.

4. **Seamless Integration with Educational Technology**:
   - The system integrates smoothly with most classroom technology platforms, allowing for ease of setup and use alongside existing tools.

5. **Adapting to Classroom Conditions**:
   - The system is designed to perform well even in varying lighting and background conditions, maintaining accuracy and stability during classroom activities.

6. **Real-Time Translation for Deaf Students**:
   - Educators can activate a mode that provides real-time sign language translation of spoken language for deaf students, ensuring inclusivity during lectures or class discussions.

This setup helps educators in learning environment, allowing both deaf and hearing students to engage fully in classroom activities.
